<p>Building large language models from scratch is an incredible learning experience. In this post, I'll share how I created iLLuMinator-4.7B, a transformer-based model with RAG capabilities.</p>

<h2>Why Build Your Own LLM?</h2>

<p>While pre-trained models are powerful, building your own gives you:</p>

<ul>
<li>Complete understanding of the architecture</li>
<li>Full control over training data and objectives</li>
<li>Ability to customize for specific domains</li>
<li>Learning experience that's invaluable</li>
</ul>

<h2>Architecture Overview</h2>

<p>iLLuMinator-4.7B uses a decoder-only transformer architecture with several key innovations:</p>

<p><strong>Core Architecture:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>48 transformer layers</li>
<li>64 attention heads</li>
<li>4096 hidden dimensions</li>
<li>Custom positional encoding</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>RAG Integration:</strong> The model includes a retrieval system that can access external knowledge bases during inference, significantly improving factual accuracy.</p>

<h2>Training Process</h2>

<p>Training a 4.7B parameter model required careful planning:</p>

<p><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Curated a diverse dataset of 500GB of text from books, papers, and web content with careful filtering and deduplication.</p>

<p><strong>Training Infrastructure:</strong> Used multiple RTX 4090 GPUs with gradient accumulation and mixed precision training to handle the large model size.</p>

<p><strong>Optimization:</strong> Implemented custom learning rate scheduling, gradient clipping, and regularization techniques to ensure stable training.</p>

<h2>Performance Results</h2>

<p>After 3 months of training, iLLuMinator-4.7B achieved:</p>

<ul>
<li>Competitive performance on language understanding benchmarks</li>
<li>Strong reasoning capabilities in mathematical and logical tasks</li>
<li>Excellent coherence in long-form text generation</li>
<li>Improved factual accuracy through RAG integration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

<p>This project taught me valuable lessons about:</p>

<ul>
<li>The importance of data quality over quantity</li>
<li>Scaling challenges and optimization techniques</li>
<li>The power of retrieval-augmented generation</li>
<li>Evaluation methodologies for large models</li>
</ul>

<p>The model and training code are available on my GitHub, along with detailed documentation for anyone interested in replicating or building upon this work.</p>
