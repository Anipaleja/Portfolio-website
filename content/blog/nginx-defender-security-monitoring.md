<p>Web server security is crucial in today's threat landscape. This post covers how I built nginx-defender, a real-time monitoring tool that automatically detects and blocks malicious behavior.</p>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Modern web servers face constant attacks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Brute force login attempts</li>
<li>DDoS attacks</li>
<li>Vulnerability scanners</li>
<li>Bot traffic and scraping</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditional solutions are often slow, resource-heavy, or require complex configuration. I wanted something lightweight and effective.</p>

<h2>Solution Architecture</h2>

<p>nginx-defender uses a multi-component architecture:</p>

<p><strong>Log Parser:</strong> Real-time nginx access log monitoring using Go's efficient file watching capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Pattern Detection:</strong> Statistical analysis of request patterns to identify suspicious behavior including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request frequency analysis</li>
<li>HTTP status code patterns</li>
<li>User agent filtering</li>
<li>Geographic anomaly detection</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Action Engine:</strong> Automated response system that can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add IP addresses to iptables rules</li>
<li>Update nginx configuration</li>
<li>Send alerts to administrators</li>
<li>Log incidents for analysis</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<p><strong>Real-time Processing:</strong> Sub-second detection and response times using Go's concurrency primitives.</p>

<p><strong>Configurable Rules:</strong> YAML-based configuration for easy customization of detection rules and thresholds.</p>

<p><strong>Whitelist Support:</strong> Comprehensive whitelist system to prevent blocking legitimate traffic.</p>

<p><strong>Metrics and Monitoring:</strong> Built-in Prometheus metrics for observability and performance monitoring.</p>

<h2>Performance Results</h2>

<p>In production testing, nginx-defender achieved:</p>

<ul>
<li>99.8% uptime with minimal resource usage</li>
<li>Average detection time under 500ms</li>
<li>90% reduction in malicious traffic reaching applications</li>
<li>Zero false positives with proper configuration</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deployment and Usage</h2>

<p>The tool is designed for easy deployment:</p>

<p><strong>Installation:</strong> Single binary with no external dependencies beyond nginx log access.</p>

<p><strong>Configuration:</strong> Simple YAML file for rules and thresholds.</p>

<p><strong>Integration:</strong> Works with existing nginx installations without modification.</p>

<p>nginx-defender is open source and available on GitHub with comprehensive documentation and examples for common use cases.</p>
